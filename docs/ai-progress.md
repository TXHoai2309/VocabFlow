# Current Handoff Snapshot

- Project: VocabFlow Family MVP
- Current phase/batch: BATCH 1
- Current active story: US-01 Parent Registration
- Story status: IN PROGRESS
- Current Git branch: `TXH`
- Baseline HEAD before documentation pack: `24e4580`
- Documentation/agent pack status: finalized and approved for repository baseline
- Last accepted baseline: BATCH 0 Foundation, recorded in commit `24e4580`
  with implementation baseline `2429b0f`
- CI status: Core CI PASS
- Database acceptance status: Trusted DB Integration PASS on Neon PostgreSQL 18
- Current implementation focus: US-01 Phase 1 Register UI/form behavior,
  including the approved parent name/email/password contract
- Last completed work: US-01 Phase 1 Register UI (T01-01/T01-02/T01-03);
  BATCH 0 Foundation remains accepted and frozen.
- Files/areas most recently changed: `apps/web/src/features/auth/`, the web
  router/styles, and the US-01 story handoff docs; no database or CI areas changed.
- Tests/evidence: Acceptance record under
  `docs/implementation/BATCH0_FOUNDATION_ACCEPTANCE.md`; `pnpm lint`,
  `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (82/82), `pnpm build` and `git diff --check`
  PASS; local Playwright render checks pass at 375/768/1280px.
- Open blockers: None. `US01_BLOCKED_BETTER_AUTH_NAME_CONTRACT` is resolved by
  the approved explicit parent display-name field. Successful registration
  includes authenticated Better Auth signup followed by idempotent
  `POST /api/bootstrap`.
- Frozen areas: BATCH 0 bootstrap, role model, database targets, schemas, reset
  policy, migration executor and CI behavior unless a proven regression appears.
- Next safe action: Implement T01-04 Better Auth signup + household
  persistence/bootstrap integration under the corrected story contract.
- Do NOT do next: Do not call Neon, modify migrations, or reopen BATCH 0 without
  regression evidence.
- Documents new agent must read first: `docs/README.md`,
  `docs/product/product-spec.md`, `docs/architecture/technical-architecture.md`,
  `docs/design/design-system.md`, `docs/design/feature-ui-spec.md`,
  `docs/flow/user-flow.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, the active
  story and this file.

## 2026-09-08 — Documentation and Agent Pack

### Goal

Create canonical Markdown documentation and a VocabFlow-specific AI-agent
operating contract before BATCH 1 implementation.

### Completed

- Audited the repository tree, package/configuration, apps, packages, Drizzle,
  scripts, workflows and current Git state.
- Converted six active canonical DOCX documents to Markdown.
- Added documentation index, source-baseline map, decisions, changelog,
  roadmap, story templates and US-01 contract.
- Added root `AGENTS.md` with VocabFlow scope, architecture, security, testing,
  documentation and Git rules.

### Decisions

- Family MVP remains the active product baseline; Personal MVP is historical.
- BATCH 0 is accepted and frozen.
- US-01 success boundary is Better Auth signup → authenticated session →
  `POST /api/bootstrap` → canonical default household resolved.

### Files changed

- Canonical Markdown files under `docs/product`, `docs/architecture`,
  `docs/design`, `docs/flow` and `docs/implementation`.
- Documentation governance files under `docs/`.
- Story system under `docs/stories/` and `docs/templates/`.
- Root `AGENTS.md`.

### Verification

- Textual parity check: all source paragraphs and table cells found in their
  Markdown counterpart.
- DOCX sources contain no embedded media or diagrams requiring binary export.
- Markdown link/fence validation: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS.
- `pnpm test`: PASS (10 files, 73 tests).
- `pnpm build`: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Packaged DOCX renderer could not run because bundled LibreOffice was not
  available in this environment; no DOCX output was authored.

### Remaining / blockers

- No contract blocker remains; no feature implementation has started.

### Next safe action

- Begin US-01 implementation from `T01-01`; keep learner creation out of scope.

## 2026-09-08 — Finalize documentation governance and US-01 contract

### Goal

Resolve the documentation status gate and finalize the owner-approved US-01
registration boundary before feature implementation.

### Completed

- Aligned `docs/README.md`, `docs/stories/README.md` and `AGENTS.md` on the
  shared story status model.
- Set BATCH 1 and US-01 to `READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION`.
- Accepted success boundary: Better Auth signup → authenticated session →
  `POST /api/bootstrap` → canonical default household resolved.
- Explicitly kept learner creation and new database schema/migration out of
  US-01.
- Corrected architecture conversion metadata to preserve source status
  `APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION`.

### Verification

- Relative Markdown links and anchors: PASS.
- Vietnamese Unicode scan: PASS.
- No stale active DOCX links; remaining DOCX names are source-baseline/history
  references only.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- No application code, database code, migrations, CI or BATCH 0 changed.

### Remaining / blockers

- None for the accepted US-01 contract.
- Documentation/agent pack remains uncommitted by instruction.

### Next safe action

- Continue US-01 with T01-04 Better Auth + household bootstrap integration.

## 2026-09-08 — US-01 Phase 1 Register UI

### Completed

- Moved US-01 to `IN PROGRESS` and implemented T01-01/T01-02/T01-03.
- Added the `/register` focused auth screen, accessible email/password
  validation, password visibility toggle, Enter submit and autocomplete.
- Kept T01-04 (real Better Auth signup and authenticated household bootstrap)
  out of scope for this phase.

### Verification

- Component tests cover route rendering, validation, submit seam, keyboard
  submit, password toggle, autocomplete and error semantics.
- `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` and `pnpm build` pass.
- No database, migration, bootstrap, role-model, reset or CI changes.

### Next safe action

- Implement T01-04 Better Auth signup followed by idempotent `POST /api/bootstrap`.

## 2026-09-08 — US-01 Phase 1 checkpoint and contract correction

### Proven dependency

- The repository currently has `/api/auth/*` and Better Auth's four auth tables,
  but no `/api/bootstrap`, `households` or `household_members`; the only
  migration is the auth foundation migration.
- BATCH 0 TE-08 intentionally established Better Auth Foundation only and did
  not implement the Family household domain.

### Contract correction

- T01-04 may add the minimal additive BATCH 1 application migration for
  `vocabflow_app.households` and `vocabflow_app.household_members` using the
  approved Architecture contract.
- This does not reopen BATCH 0: role model, `vocabflow_meta`, target identity,
  bootstrap infrastructure, migration executor and reset architecture remain
  frozen.
- Learner profiles/creation and vocabulary, progress and review tables remain
  out of scope for US-01.

### Checkpoint

- Phase 1 (T01-01/T01-02/T01-03) is completed and checkpointed on branch `TXH`.
- Story status remains `IN PROGRESS`; T01-04 has not started.
- Next safe action: implement T01-04 signup plus household
  persistence/bootstrap.
- Do NOT do next: learner profile/learner UI or unrelated BATCH 0 changes.

## 2026-09-08 — Resolve Better Auth name contract blocker

### Proven blocker

- Better Auth 1.7.2 `signUp.email` requires `name`, `email` and `password`.
- The previous Phase 1 form exposed only email and password, so T01-04 could
  not safely call the pinned API without inventing a parent identity.

### Accepted resolution

- US-01 now explicitly collects `Tên phụ huynh`, `Email` and `Mật khẩu`.
- Name is required, trimmed before the Phase-1 seam, and accepts normal
  Vietnamese/Unicode text. It is the parent display/profile identity; learner
  name and learner creation remain out of scope, and household name remains
  server-owned.
- `US01_BLOCKED_BETTER_AUTH_NAME_CONTRACT` is RESOLVED.

### Checkpoint

- US-01 remains `IN PROGRESS`; T01-04 remains pending.
- No Better Auth signup request, `/api/bootstrap`, household migration or
  learner/domain implementation was started.
- BATCH 0 remains frozen.

### Next safe action

- Implement T01-04 Better Auth signup + household persistence/bootstrap.
